Simple Byte Reader/Serializer Class

- Write a class which takes Buffer(a char array) and its size as input in constructor

	- provides interfaces to read/show 1/2/4 bytes in little endian or big endian, while updating internal offset of Buffer.
	  - following interfaces
		
		unsigned long readBE(int n) //read big endian, internal offset updated, the value of n is from 1 to 4
		
		unsigned long readLE(int n) //read litle endian, internal offset updated
		
		unsigned long showBE(int n) //just return big endian, without updating internal offset
		
		unsigned long showLE(int n) //just return big endian, without updating internal offset
		
		int tell()  // returns the current postion(offset) in internal buffer
		
		int total()  // returns the total size of internal buffer
		
		int remaining()  // returns the remaining bytes in internal buffer
		
		void flush(int n)  // moves the current position ahead by n bytes
		
	
	
- Use the class to read a wav file header and show following as output: Channel Count, Sampling Frequency, Bits per sample
	-Read and verify Big Endian Chunk ids (RIFF, fmt, data)
